We assume prior familiarity with numpy and matplotlib. The material in this lab serve as an important basis of your assigments. Therefore, make sure to familiarize yourself with them before the first assignment is due. This lab is not going to be graded and we will make the solutions available later. "

        "## Code style\n",
        "Unlike for example C++ where people just can't agree exactly what the best way is to place brackets, for Python there is just one key standard for how good clean code looks like: PEP8. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. You can find the official description [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). A bit lighter reading version that gives more explanation is [here](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/).\n",
        "\n",
        "Writing clean code is important. It's very common that you find yourself doing some project and thinking, \"hey, I solved this little problem in another problem two months ago, how did I do that again?\" If you wrote nice clean code, it's easy to look up how you did it. Likewise, if you're working together with people, it's easier if you understand what others are doing. Adhering (sensibly) to PEP8 makes this easy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original PEP8 standard assumes a 80-character line limit, but with modern screens, it's reasonable to assume a 120 character line limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python also has a very definite philosophy behind it, and knowing that philosophy will make it easier to understand how a lot of things are designed in Python. It's called The Zen of Python, officially documented as PEP20, and can be found [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) and there are many essays explaining these 19 statements, for example [here](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2018/08/17/the-zen-of-python-explained/). Note though that every article explaining them is subtly different. They're intended to make you think, not blindly follow :)"

Clearly, those different kinds of things don't all need the same kind of memory, so they can't be stored in a neat row of equal-size chunks in memory. When you decide to referce item 10 of a list, Python has to look up where item 10 is stored. Meanwhile, a Numpy array is strictly homogenous in its data type - it's all float64, or all integer32 and so forth. Each cell in the array is the same size, so if you know where the array starts, you can easily calculate where each value is.

        "You'll also notice that this plot uses a lot of calls on the `ax` object and a few on `fig`, but not a lot of calls to `plt`. In a lot of tutorials you'll see most of the same code, but all calls made to `plt`. Why is that?\n",
        "\n",
        "Basically, Matplotlib got started as a port of MATLAB plotting capabilities to Python. `plt` is basically a placeholder that points to the most recent figure you were working on. That's fine as long as you're only working on one plot in a project, but it can become confusing if you're generating a lot of pictures.\n",
        "\n",
        "What we do when we call `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` is generate a new *Figure* with in this case one *Axes* object. The Axes object is what we think of as the actual plot: it has an X and Y axis (hence the name, axes, plural of axis), and it's where we're drawing on. The Figure is more like the windowframe around it. We can have a Figure with multiple Axes in it, which is what happens if you call [plt.subplots](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html) with arguments to indicate how many you'd like; then instead of a single Axes object, you get a bunch of them.  For a more extensive tutorial of \"best practices\" Matplotlib, I recommend [Python Plotting With Matplotlib (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/) and [Effectively Using Matplotlib](https://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html)."
